# Chess Engine Project

## Overview
This repository is created for educational purposes to practice **Python**, **Git**, **GitHub**, and collaborative development of project with many team members from diferent environments.

### Main Objectives:
The goal of this project is to **create a simple chess engine** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. This includes:
- Create chess pieces as objects
- Implement the chess board as object
- Managing game flow and the chess rules

## Requirements (so far):

- **Python** 3.12+
- **Numpy** 2.1.2

## Code Guidelines:

To maintain professionalism and consistency, please follow these guidelines:

- **Language**: Use **only English** for variable names, comments, and documentation.
- **Type Annotations**: Always use type annotations to improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Constants**: Use the `Enum` class to declare constants for better clarity and structure.
- **Version Control**: Use **Git** and **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.

## Future Enhancements:

Once the core chess engine is completed, we can explore adding the following features:

1. **Networking**:
   - Add connection support using Python's `socket` library.
   - Implement **P2P** connectivity for multiplayer games.
   
2. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**:
   - Create a **CLI implementation** for the chess game, potentially supporting **SSH** to play remotely.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Host the chess engine on **AWS** for public access.
   - Self-host the engine on a **Raspberry Pi** for local or personal use.

4. **Logging**:
   - Add a logging mechanism to track user actions, game states, and errors.

5. **Frontend**:
   - Implement a **JavaScript frontend** for a web-based interface to play the game.
     
6. **Dektop version**:
   - Implement a **Tkinter** GUI desktop application.
     
7. **Customization**:
   - Allow users to add their own **custom chess skins**.

8. **Video Streaming**:
   - Implement **video streaming** using the **UDP protocol** for live game broadcasts.

9. **AI Development**:
   - Sprinkle some AI magic.
